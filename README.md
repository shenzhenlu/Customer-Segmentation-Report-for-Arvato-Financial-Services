# Customer-Segmentation-Report-for-Arvato-Financial-Services

In this project, we will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, 
comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We'll use unsupervised learning 
techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the 
core customer base of the company. Then, we'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics
information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals 
are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you we use has been provided 
by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
